# Object-Serialization-in-Cpp

#A tiny  CPP implememtation of serialization and deserialization

#The simple type serialization（including cpp Arithmetic && std:: string  && std::container） binary is done in  folder singleType.

#The user define type is done in the visual studio folder Project1.

#The simple type serialization（including cpp Arithmetic && std:: string  && std::container） xml is done in visual studio folder Project2

the reason why we use 2 different project is the single type could be done just in GCC5.1.0+,but user_define_type  and xml must be done in visual studio 2017+

all 3 folders have testcode and srccode, we do not put all test case in one file because test all the case in one file  spend too much time and make the code in a mess
