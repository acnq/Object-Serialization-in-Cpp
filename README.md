# Object-Serialization-in-Cpp
#A tiny  CPP implememtation of serialization and deserialization
#The simple type serialization（including cpp Arithmetic && std:: string  && std::container） is done in  folder singleType
#The user define type is done in the visual studio folder Project1.
the reason why we use 2 different project is the single type could be done just in GCC5.1.0+,but user_define_type must be done in visual studio 2017+
